This directory contains the blob mering efforts of the project.

This branch attempts to merge redundant blobs on a vehicle using physical proximity.
Simply put, most detected cars are detected multiple times. By utilizing a Euclidean
distance metric and an implementation of DBSCAN, this branch clusters blobs by spatial
proximity and attempts to merge them.

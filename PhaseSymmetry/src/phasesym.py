    """  Arguments:
                   Default values      Description
     
         nscale           5    - Number of wavelet scales, try values 3-6
         norient          6    - Number of filter orientations.
         minWaveLength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
         mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
         sigmaOnf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
                                 describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
                                 in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
         k                2.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
                                 the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
                                 You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
                                 20 for noisy images 
         polarity         0    - Controls 'polarity' of symmetry features to find.
                                  1 - just return 'bright' points
                                 -1 - just return 'dark' points
                                  0 - return bright and dark points.
         noiseMethod      -1   - Parameter specifies method used to determine
                                 noise statistics. 
                                   -1 use median of smallest scale filter responses
                                   -2 use mode of smallest scale filter responses
                                    0+ use noiseMethod value as the fixed noise threshold.
     
      Return values:
         phaseSym              - Phase symmetry image (values between 0 and 1).
         orientation           - Orientation image. Orientation in which local
                                 symmetry energy is a maximum, in degrees
                                 (0-180), angles positive anti-clockwise. Note
                                 the orientation info is quantized by the number
                                 of orientations
         totalEnergy           - Un-normalised raw symmetry energy which may be
                                 more to your liking.
         T                     - Calculated noise threshold (can be useful for
                                 diagnosing noise characteristics of images).  Once you know
                                 this you can then specify fixed thresholds and save some
                                 computation time.
     
      Notes on specifying parameters:
      
      The parameters can be specified as a full list eg.
       >> phaseSym = phasesym(im, 5, 6, 3, 2.5, 0.55, 2.0, 0);
     
      or as a partial list with unspecified parameters taking on default values
       >> phaseSym = phasesym(im, 5, 6, 3);
     
      or as a partial list of parameters followed by some parameters specified via a
      keyword-value pair, remaining parameters are set to defaults, for example:
       >> phaseSym = phasesym(im, 5, 6, 3, 'polarity',-1, 'k', 2.5);
      
      The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
      specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
      to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
      experiment with the values of 'nscales' and 'k', the noise compensation factor.
     
      Notes on filter settings to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
      sigmaOnf       .85   mult 1.3
      sigmaOnf       .75   mult 1.6     (filter bandwidth ~1 octave)
      sigmaOnf       .65   mult 2.1  
      sigmaOnf       .55   mult 3       (filter bandwidth ~2 octaves)
     
      For maximum speed the input image should have dimensions that correspond to
      powers of 2, but the code will operate on images of arbitrary size.

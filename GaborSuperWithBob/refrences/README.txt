This is the paper from which our main approach was pulled. Unfortunately, the 
authors of this paper did some hand waving when it came to the specific details
of their approach. It was later discovered (after investigating their sources) 
that most of the approach was lifted from another paper. The original paper is
provided as

     'vehicle_deteection_from_aerial_images_using_localshape_information.pdf',

and the more informative paper is provided as

    'Symmetry and Asymmery from Local Phase.pdf'
